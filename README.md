# AZ_DevZLauncher

After Zero - DevZ Launcher is a simple tool made with the soul purpose of making modding DayZ a little bit easier, currently I needed several windows open, multiple batch files, and more while working on mods for DayZ. This gets confusing and irritating when you have so many windows open, so to help minimize the ammount of windows open at one time, I combined all my most used windows into one for anyone to use.

## Getting Started

This github contains the source code for the program, and the actual EXE can be found in the bin/Debug folder or where ever else I have made it available.
